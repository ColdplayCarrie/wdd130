            <p>Hi! I'm Carrie Amdal. I am a student at BYU-Idaho. I am currently pursuing my associate degree in Family History Research and
            will graduate with my bachelors degree in Professional Studies at the end of 2024. I am married and mother to five children and a daughter-in-law.
            I absolutely love (and am a bit obsessed) with the band Coldplay. I have been to nine Coldplay concerts since 2009. Twice I had my tickets for seats way up
            high in the nose-bleed section traded out (by Coldplay roadies) for floor tickets! ...third row tickets for one concert and front row tickets for the other!  
            My favorite books and movies are The Lord of the Rings series. I love cookies and Dr Pepper. I teach piano lessons to 13 students and enjoy photography.
            It may sound corny, but I love Jesus and hope to be like Him someday. :)</p>
