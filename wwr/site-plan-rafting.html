            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>We aim to provide an unforgettable getaway where you can reconnect with the great outdoors through the thrill of adventure!</p>
                <h3>Audience</h3>
                <p>Who are the target customers? 
                    Our target customers are those who enjoy the outdoors but are often stuck in the office. 
                    These would be people between the ages of 30-50, who spend a lot of their weekdays indoors. They are people who like to be busy and love adventure.
                    They wish they could spend more time outdoors with their family, which consists of all ages of children. 
                    Financially, they are doing fine but both parents work in order to pay for their children's hobbies and interests. 
                    We are also targeting young adults who seek the thrill that comes from adventure. They are students or those who are starting out in the workforce so they generally
                    do not have much money.
                Why are they visiting the website?
                    They are looking for something fun to do that can be done in a day. They hope to find something that is relatively inexpensive and something that
                    does not require a lot of prep or equipment that they have to provide. They want something different than what they deal with every day.
                How will they access the website? Young adults will typically use their mobile devices, such as phones, to access the site. Those who are between 30-50 will
                    most likely access the website from a tablet, iPad, laptop, or desktop computer.
